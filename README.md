# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👋

This repository hosts my profile README, which appears at the top of my GitHub page.  
It’s a space to introduce myself, highlight my skills, and share projects or interests.  
I use it to showcase my background in finance, data analysis, and technology, along with links to connect.
